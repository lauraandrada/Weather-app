# Weather-app 🌦️

The app uses the public Weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com/) to fetch data for each city. 
The cicites can be inputed manually and availble options are shown after entering at least 3 characters. 

The details displayed for each city are the following: 
🟡 a random image from that city (if available),
🟡 city name,
🟡 country name,
🟡 region,
🟡 weather icon depending on the weather type (sunny, clear, etc.),
🟡 current weather type,
🟡 temperature, 
🟡 feels like,
🟡 UV index,
